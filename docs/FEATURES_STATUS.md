## Recommended Pricing Doc Updates

### Option 1: Conservative (Match Implementation)

### Option 2: Aspirational (Current Docs)

Keep current pricing docs as "roadmap" but add:
- ‚úÖ Available now
- üîÑ Coming soon (with timeline)
- üìÖ Planned for [Quarter]

### Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Immediate (docs/PRICING_AND_FEATURES.md):**
- Clearly mark what's available now
- Separate "Enterprise Features" as roadmap
- Add implementation status badges

**Example:**
```markdown
## Premium Plan

‚úÖ **Available Now:**

   - Be transparent about timelines

## Conclusion

**What We Built (Very Strong):**
- ‚úÖ Complete multi-tenant organization system
- ‚úÖ Robust seat-based billing
- ‚úÖ Excellent collaboration features
- ‚úÖ Production-ready code with tests
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation

**What's Next (Clear Roadmap):**
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Enterprise security (SAML, SOC 2)
- Mobile and desktop apps
- Advanced AI features
- White-label options

**Recommendation:**
The multi-tenant implementation is **production-ready** for Free through Business Plus tiers. Enterprise features should be sold as "custom engagements" with clear timelines.

The pricing documentation is aspirational but should be updated to clearly indicate what's available now versus planned for future releases.
