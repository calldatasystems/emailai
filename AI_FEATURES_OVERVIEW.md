## Email Automation & Rules

### ✅ AI-Powered Rule Creation
**Status**: Fully Implemented

**What it does:**
- Converts natural language to automation rules
- Understands complex conditions and actions
- Creates multi-step workflows from plain English

**Examples:**
```
User: "Archive all newsletters from sender X"
AI creates: IF sender is X AND is newsletter THEN archive

User: "Label urgent emails from my boss and reply with draft"
AI creates: IF from:boss@company.com AND contains urgent
           THEN add label "Urgent" AND draft reply

User: "Forward receipts to accounting@company.com"
AI creates: IF is receipt THEN forward to accounting@company.com
```

**How it works:**
```typescript
// User provides plain English prompt
const prompt = "Archive all newsletters from TechCrunch";

// AI converts to structured rule
const rule = {
  conditions: [
    { type: "FROM", value: "newsletter@techcrunch.com" },
    { type: "CATEGORY", value: "Newsletter" }
  ],
  actions: [
    { type: "ARCHIVE" }
  ]
};
```

**Actions Supported:**
- ✅ Archive email
- ✅ Add label/tag
- ✅ Draft reply
- ✅ Send reply
- ✅ Forward email
- ✅ Mark as spam
- ✅ Mark as read
- ✅ Call webhook (custom integrations)
- ✅ Track thread (follow-up reminders)

**File**: `utils/ai/rule/prompt-to-rules.ts`

---

### ✅ AI Rule Selection & Execution
**Status**: Fully Implemented

**What it does:**
- Automatically chooses which rule(s) to apply to each email
- Fills in dynamic arguments (e.g., who to forward to)
- Executes actions with context awareness

**How it works:**
```typescript
// AI analyzes incoming email
const email = {
  from: "john@example.com",
  subject: "Invoice #12345",
  body: "Please find attached invoice..."
};

// AI chooses matching rule
const matchedRule = await chooseRule(email, userRules);
// Result: "Forward receipts to accounting"

// AI fills in dynamic arguments
const action = {
  type: "FORWARD",
  to: "accounting@company.com",
  content: "FYI - Invoice from john@example.com"
};

// Execute action
await executeAction(action);
```

**Smart Features:**
- Understands email context and intent
- Fills in placeholders intelligently
- Handles edge cases (e.g., "reply to sender" knows who sender is)
- Suggests rule improvements based on patterns

**Files**:
- `utils/ai/choose-rule/ai-choose-rule.ts`

AI suggests: "Create a rule to auto-archive Daily Digest emails?"

AI notices: You always forward invoices from Stripe to accounting
AI suggests: "Auto-forward Stripe invoices to accounting@company.com?"
```

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Analyze user's manual actions
const patterns = await detectRecurringPatterns({
  userId,
  timeRange: "last_30_days"
});

// Suggest rule
{
  pattern: "You archived 15 newsletters from TechCrunch",
  suggestedRule: "Auto-archive TechCrunch newsletters",
  confidence: 0.95
}
```

**File**: `utils/ai/choose-rule/ai-detect-recurring-pattern.ts`

## Technical Implementation

### AI Models Used

**Primary Models (Configurable):**
- OpenAI GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini
- Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet (via Anthropic or AWS Bedrock)
- Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro
- Groq Llama 3.3 70B (ultra-fast inference)
- Meta Llama 3.1/3.3 (local via Ollama)
- Mixtral, Qwen (local via Ollama)

**Default Strategy:**
```typescript
// Primary: User's choice or Groq (free/fast)
DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=groq

// Economy: Cheaper model for bulk tasks
ECONOMY_LLM_PROVIDER=google
ECONOMY_LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-lite
```

### How AI Features Work

**Context Injection Pattern** (All features use this):
```typescript
async function aiFeature(userInput: string, userId: string) {
  // 1. Gather user context
  const context = {
    knowledge: await getKnowledgeBase(userId),
    writingStyle: await getWritingStyle(userId),
    preferences: await getUserPreferences(userId),
    history: await getRelevantHistory(userId)
  };

  // 2. Build prompt with context
  const prompt = `
    ${context.knowledge}
    ${context.writingStyle}
    ${context.preferences}

    User request: ${userInput}
  `;

  // 3. Call LLM
  const response = await llm.complete(prompt);

  // 4. Return result
  return response;
}
```

**No model fine-tuning needed** - all personalization comes from context injection.
