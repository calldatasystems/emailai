To achieve this, we utilize a CCAT\r\n> (Cognitive and Critical Thinking Assessment) and a personality test as part\r\n> of our evaluation process. These assessments are not meant to judge or\r\n> categorize candidates as pass or fail; instead, they serve as valuable\r\n> tools to gain a deeper understanding of how you prefer to work and process\r\n> information. The process only takes about 25 minutes. We view this as an\r\n> opportunity to have a more productive and engaging discussion during the\r\n> interview, ensuring that we can better align your strengths and preferences\r\n> with the right role within our organization. Embracing these assessments\r\n> allows us to make the most informed decisions and helps you put your best\r\n> foot forward in showcasing your unique skills and abilities!\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> We are excited to continue our conversations and find a career opportunity\r\n> for you at Cytracom!\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Tina Rodgers*\r\n>\r\n> Senior Technical Recruiter - Client Partnership Specialist\r\n>\r\n> *m: **214.282.4671*\r\n>\r\n> *e: <tina.rodgers@talentgroups.com>**tina.rodgers@talentgroups.com\r\n> <tina.rodgers@talentgroups.com>*\r\n>\r\n> *www.talentgroups.com <https://www.talentgroups.com/>*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Formerly known as **Abacus Technical Services*\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n> *From:* Tina Rodgers\r\n> *Sent:* Wednesday, June 4, 2025 3:14:50 PM\r\n> *To:* apeacock@aqorn.com <apeacock@aqorn.com>\r\n> *Subject:* RE: Onsite Interview: Cytracom - Wednesday, 6/4, at 4pm CST\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Adam,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Andy sent this to me:* Let him know there's a garage about 50ft away from\r\n> the office he can park - no ground floor security, just go to the elevators\r\n> and head to floor 8 (they have the whole floor) - Becca should be at the\r\n> front desk and they should be waiting for him - sign in, he'll get a badge\r\n> and they'll go to a conference room to talk about the opportunity.*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Tina Rodgers*\r\n>\r\n> Sr. Technical Recruiter - Client Partnership Specialist\r\n>\r\n> *m: *214.282.4671 <214.282.4671>\r\n>\r\n> *e: *tina.rodgers@talentgroups.com <tina.rodgers@talentgroups.com>\r\n>\r\n> www.talentgroups.com\r\n>\r\n> *Formerly known as **Abacus Technical Services*\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *From:* Tina Rodgers\r\n> *Sent:* Wednesday, June 4, 2025 2:47 PM\r\n> *To:* apeacock@aqorn.com\r\n> *Subject:* Onsite Interview: Cytracom - Wednesday, 6/4, at 4pm CST\r\n> *Importance:* High\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Hi Adam,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> You are confirmed to interview onsite: *Wednesday, 6/4, at 4pm CST. *\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Address:* 7300 State Hwy 121, Suite 800 McKinney TX 75070\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *Parking**: *You can park out front in visitor parking or the parking\r\n> garage\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *You will meet with:*\r\n>\r\n>    - Jon Roemer - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jroemer/\r\n>    - James Hill (CISO) - *https://www.linkedin.com/in/cisojameshill/\r\n>    <https://www.linkedin.com/in/cisojameshill/>*\r\n>    - David Frazier (new Dir of Infra) -\r\n>    https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidkf"}
